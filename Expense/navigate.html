              It is important to keep track of your expenses to ensure that you
              are not overspending and staying within your budget. By reviewing
              your past expenses, you can identify areas where you may have
              overspent and make adjustments for the future. This can also help
              you to prioritize your spending, ensuring that your essential
              expenses are covered before allocating funds for non-essential
              items.

              When you add your expense summary, you are essentially creating a
              record of all your expenses, which can include items such as
              bills, groceries, rent, and other necessary expenses. By having
              this record, you can easily track your spending and identify areas
              where you may be overspending. This can help you adjust your
              budget accordingly to ensure that you stay within your salary
